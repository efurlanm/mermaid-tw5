# mermaid-tw5

>Note: This plugin is no longer maintained due to a significant change (ESM) in Mermaid 10 that makes it incompatible with the plugin. Furthermore, from Mermaid 9.4.0 onwards the plugin tripled in size, becoming larger than the size of the empty TiddlyWiki single HTML file, becoming a huge overhead.

The mermaid-tw5 plugin is a wrapper for Mermaid (https://mermaid.js.org).

TiddlyWiki website/notebook including the plugin: http://efurlanm.github.io/mermaid-tw5 . You can install the plugin by navigating to the site and dragging the plugin link to your TiddlyWiki.

I'm not the author of the plugin, I just got what I was already ready, and updated the files to the latest version. All credits are from the original authors:

* http://github.com/cedarvera/mermaid-tw5
* http://github.com/jceb/mermaid-tw5
* https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid
* and others

As I didn't make the plugin, I have no idea how to eliminate issues. Please contact the original authors.

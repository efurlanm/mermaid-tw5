# mermaid-tw5

Wrapper for mermaid (http://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid)

Website/plugin: http://efurlanm.github.io/mermaid-tw5

You can install the plugin by navigating to the site and dragging the link to your TiddlyWiki. More instructions on the website.

I'm not the author of the plugin, I just got what I was already ready, and updated the mermaid.js to the latest version. All credits are from the original authors.

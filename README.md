# mermaid-tw5

Wrapper for mermaid (http://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid)

Website/plugin: http://efurlanm.github.io/mermaid-tw5

You can install the plugin by navigating to the site and dragging the link to your TiddlyWiki. More instructions on the website.

I'm not the author of the plugin, I just got what I was already ready, and updated the mermaid.js to the latest version. All credits are from the original authors.


# About TiddlyWiki

TiddlyWiki (http://tiddlywiki.com) in single-file configuration typically bundles everything into a single file: the data, images, text, plugins, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML that make up TiddlyWiki itself. This lack of dependencies is usually very convenient: it means it greatly increases the chances that it will still work in the future. It also allows you to download the HTML file from the Internet (using the `Save changes` button) and send it by email or whatsapp, it will work anywhere, including your smartphone, as it does not require an external reader or the installation of any additional software.

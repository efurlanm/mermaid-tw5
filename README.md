# mermaid-tw5

*Last edited: 2024-03-17*

The mermaid-tw5 plugin is a wrapper for Mermaid (<https://mermaid.js.org>).

TiddlyWiki notebook including the plugin: <http://efurlanm.github.io/mermaid-tw5> . You can install the plugin by navigating to the site and dragging the plugin link to your TiddlyWiki.

I'm not the author of the plugin, I just got what I was already ready, and updated the files to the latest version. All credits are from the original authors:

* <http://github.com/gt6796c/mermaid-tw5>
* <http://github.com/jasonmhoule/tw5-mermaid>
* <http://github.com/cedarvera/mermaid-tw5>
* <http://github.com/jceb/mermaid-tw5>
* <https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid>
* and others

Notes:

1. The mermaid.min.js 9.3.0 version currently used in the plugin is 0.9 MB in size and works well.
2. The new version 10.9.0 of mermaid.min.js is 3.2 MB in size, while the empty TiddlyWiki 5.3.3 is 2.4 MB, which makes the new version of mermaid a huge overhead.
3. There is a [thread in the mermaid repository](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid/issues/4616) suggesting a lite version, which would be welcome, and could eventually solve the overhead issue.
